# w209_finalproject

Metrics:  
*Voter Power

*etc.  

Recap of feedback from midterm presentation:

Issues
* minor overlap of labeling in NE region

Questions to be addressed:
* How was shortest path to flip calculated?

Suggestions:
* Region filter? (Ex: less voting power for coastal regions which typically have larger populations)
* Clearer outline in beginning of goal and scope
* Usability for other viewpoints on the EC (let the user come to agreement with you instead of forcing the viewpoint)
* Comparison between years (to understand how much electorate vote power by region has changed)
* Scenario based dashboard to see what election results would be if voting power were different (think 538 election results swing)

__MoSCoW List__  

_Must_  
3. Move results and margin to top of map  
2. Add state margin to tooltip in electoral map  
3. Use scrollbar year for both viz, take out "ALL" from scroll bar  
4. be consistent with placement of year filter (on top) and party legend (bottom)  
5. Asterisk of "swing state" should connect to footnote  
6. Infographic - need to add footnote that Winner Takes All apples to most, not all states (Maine, Nebraska)  
7. Embed into berkeley server site!  
11. Remove margin multiple  

_Should_  
1. Need to emphasize the interactivity of the chart  
8. Voter Power - Hard to see that FL is lower than CA (add light horizontal gridlines)  

_Could_  
7. Infographic should be interactive - Or use state as an example  
9. Provide explanation about what a negative number means in popular vote. Emphasize the negative values somehowv  
10. Show shortest path vs popular vote margin visually  
11. show winning candidate in system comparison chart  
12. Add infographic for voter power?  

_Wont_  
1. Flip axes on voter power

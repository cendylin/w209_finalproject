# w209_finalproject

Metrics:  
*Voter Power

*etc.  

Recap of feedback from midterm presentation:

Issues
* minor overlap of labeling in NE region

Questions to be addressed:
* How was shortest path to flip calculated?

Suggestions:
* Region filter? (Ex: less voting power for coastal regions which typically have larger populations)
* Clearer outline in beginning of goal and scope
* Usability for other viewpoints on the EC (let the user come to agreement with you instead of forcing the viewpoint)
* Comparison between years (to understand how much electorate vote power by region has changed)
* Scenario based dashboard to see what election results would be if voting power were different (think 538 election results swing)

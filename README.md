# w209_finalproject

Metrics:  
*Voter Power

*etc.  

Recap of feedback from midterm presentation:

Issues
* minor overlap of labeling in NE region

Questions to be addressed:
* How was shortest path to flip calculated?

Suggestions:
* Region filter? (Ex: less voting power for coastal regions which typically have larger populations)
* Clearer outline in beginning of goal and scope
* Usability for other viewpoints on the EC (let the user come to agreement with you instead of forcing the viewpoint)
* Comparison between years (to understand how much electorate vote power by region has changed)
* Scenario based dashboard to see what election results would be if voting power were different (think 538 election results swing)

_Must_
3. Move results and margin to top of map

3. Use scrollbar year for both viz, take out "ALL" from scroll bar
4. be consistent with placement of year filter (on top) and party legend (bottom)
5. Asterisk of "swing state" should connect to footnote

7. Embed into berkeley server site!
11. Remove margin multiple

_Should_

9. Provide explanation about what a negative number means in popular vote. Emphasize the negative values somehowv
10. Show shortest path vs popular vote margin visually
11. show winning candidate in system comparison chart
